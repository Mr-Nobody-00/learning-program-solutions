#  Financial Forecasting Tool (CTS Task)

This Java application demonstrates how to forecast future financial values using a **recursive algorithm**, with support for an optimized iterative solution.


## Understanding Recursive Algorithms

### What is Recursion?
Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller subproblems.

### Why use recursion?
- Reduces code complexity for repetitive calculations
- Natural fit for problems like growth modeling, tree traversals, etc.

### Example Use Case:
To calculate future investment value with compound interest.


## 4. Analysis & Optimization

| Method     | Time Complexity | Notes                               |
|------------|------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Recursive  | O(n)             | Simple logic, may cause stack overflow for large n |
| Iterative  | O(n)             | More efficient and stack-safe       |

### Optimization:
- Prefer iterative solution for large inputs
- Recursion is clean and useful for small or educational scenarios
